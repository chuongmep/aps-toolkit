    "\n",
    "1. **Install Python and pip**: Before you can use Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code, you need to have Python and pip, the Python package installer, installed on your computer. If you don't have them installed, you can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Pip is included with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: Once you have Python and pip installed, you can install Jupyter Notebook by opening a terminal and running the following command: `pip install notebook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Install Visual Studio Code**: If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/download).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code**: Open Visual Studio Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window. In the Extensions view, search for \"python\" and install the Python extension by Microsoft.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Open a Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code**: You can now open a Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code. To do this, go to the File menu, select Open File, and choose your .ipynb file. You can also create a new Jupyter Notebook by going to the File menu, selecting New File, and then changing the language of the file to \"Jupyter\" by clicking on the language indicator in the bottom right corner of the window and selecting \"Jupyter\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Run a Jupyter Notebook**: To run a cell in the Jupyter Notebook, click on the cell to select it, then press the \"Run Cell\" button in the top menu. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + Enter` to run the current cell and select the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to save your work frequently by pressing `Ctrl + S` or by going to the File menu and selecting Save."

    "\n",
    "2. **Create a New Notebook**: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, click on the \"New\" button (usually located in the top-right corner) and select \"Python 3\" (or the version of Python you have installed) to create a new notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enter the Command**: In your new notebook, you'll see a cell where you can write code. Click on this cell to select it, then type the command `%pip install aps-toolkit --upgrade` and press `Enter` to create a new line. The `%` at the start is a Jupyter Notebook specific syntax called a magic command. When used at the start of a line, it tells the notebook to treat the rest of the line as a command to be run in the system shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run the Command**: To run the command, you can either click on the \"Run\" button in the toolbar at the top of the page, or use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + Enter`. This will execute the command in the cell, installing or upgrading the `aps-toolkit` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check the Installation**: After running the command, you should see some output below the cell indicating that the package is being downloaded and installed. If the installation is successful, you should see a message saying \"Successfully installed aps-toolkit-...\" with the version number of the package.\n",
